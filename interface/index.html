    In the following the various components of the user interface are
    introduced and their usage described. The UI should be sufficient for most
    common use cases. However, if functionality is missing, user created

<h2><a name="3_1">3.1 Overview</a></h2>

<p class="text-justify">
    The following is a short overview of the different components that make
    up the main user interface, shown in the following image.

    <div class="text-center">

        <em>Joystick Gremlin UI</em>
    </div>
    </br>

    <ol class="text-justify">
        <li>Overview of all the inputs available for a given physical device.
            The small icons on the far right of each input indicate the type of
            actions associated with the input. The icons and their meaning are
            summarised in the table below.</li>
        <li>The right hand portion of the UI shows the list of containers and
            actions associated with the currently selected input. This panel
            allows configuring the actions to execute when the physical input
            is used.</li>
        <li>This drop down lists all available actions for this type of input.
            Pressing the "Add" button will embed the selected action in a basic
            container.</li>
        <li>This drop down contains the available containers for the currently
            selected input. Pressing the "Add" button inserts an empty
            container of the desired type.</li>
        <li>Each container can contain up to three tabs that handle
            various configurations. The <em>Action</em> tab allows the
            basic configuration of the actions. The <em>Condition</em> tab
            allows fine tuning under which conditions the action or
            container should be executed. Finally the <em>Virtual
            Button</em> allows configuring an axis or hat to be used
            like a button.</li>
        <li>The mode section allows changing the mode currently being
            configured.</li>
        <li>Each tab represents an individual device that is currently
            connected to the computer. The "Settings" tab allows configuring
            properties for the entire profile.</li>
        <li>Tool bar which holds the most commonly used actions, from
            left to right:
            <ul>
                <li>Open an existing profile.</li>
                <li>Activate Joystick Gremlin, when active the button is
                    pressed and a green icon is shown. This also changes the
                    status bar display. Pressing the button while Joystick
                    Gremlin is running will disabled it again.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The status bar shows whether or not the program is currently
            running a profile. If the program is running the currently
            active mode is shown as well if code execution is
            paused. If the input repeater is active it's status is also
            shown in the far right.</li>

<h2><a name="3_2">3.2 Virtual Buttons</a></h2>

<p class="text-justify">
    Each input has a natural behaviour or type of states it can be in.
    Certain actions, however, require a binary state reflecting that of
    buttons, i.e. <em>pressed</em> and <em>released</em>. In order for
    axis and hat inputs to support this they require to specify the
    condition under which they should be considered <em>pressed</em> and
    <em>released</em>, effectively turning them into a virtual button.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    This is often needed, for example when using individual hat directions as
    buttons when a game doesn't support mapping individual hat directions. A
    common use with axis is to enable afterburners when the throttle reaches
    100% thrust. This type of situations are where a virtual button is used.
    The details of these activation conditions is covered next.
</p>

<h3>Button and Keyboard Key</h3>
    As these inputs are already binary there is no virtual button
    configuration needed.
<p class="text-justify">
</p>

<h3>Axis</h3>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/condition_virtual_button_axis.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Turning an axis into a virtual button by specifiying the
            range in which the virtual button is considered pressed.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    Actions associated with axis inputs have a range based setup which
    simulates a button press when the axis enters the specified range and
    releases the virtual button when it leaves the range. In addition to being
    able to specify the range for the button you can also specify a direction
    in which said range has to be entered if desired. This allows triggering
    two different actions for the same range depending on the direction it is
    traversed.
</p>

<h3>Hat</h3>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/condition_virtual_button_hat.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Turning a hat into a button by selecting the directions
            which when pressed are considered to be pressing a virtual
            button.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    The eight directions of POV hats can be treated as states in which
    the virtual button is considered pressed. It is possible to select
    multiple directions at once and any of the selected directions will
    be considered as part of a single virtual button.
</p>


<h2><a name="3_3">3.3 Activation Conditions</a></h2>

<p class="text-justify">
    Sometimes executing actions when a physical input is pressed is doesn't
    provide enough control over the execution of actions. To provide additional
    control over the execution of actions Gremlin allows the user to specify
    conditions under which action can or cannot be executed.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Typical usage scenarios for this would be the use of a modifier or
    shift key to change what a particular physical input does in certain
    situations. Another common case is to trigger different actions when
    a button is pressed or released, for example on throttles with
    switches rather then buttons.
</p>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/condition_action_action.png">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/condition_container_action.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Conditions can be placed on either each action individually
        or on the container as a whole.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    As mentioned in <a href="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/interface/3_1">3.1.
        Overview</a> the conditions are configured in the condition tab
    present in every container widget. The tab allows placing conditions
    on either every action individually or on the container as a whole.
    These conditions will dictate whether or not a particular action or
    container is executed when the corresponding physical input is used.
</p>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/condition_container_action.png">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/condition_container_joystick.png">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/condition_container_keyboard.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Activation conditions can check for the state of the
            action's physical input, a physical joystick input, or a
            keyboard input.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    There are three types of conditions available:
    <dl>
        <dt>Action</dt>
        <dd>The <em>Action</em> condition checks whether or not the
        physical or virtual button triggering the action or container is
        pressed or released. This enables for example to run a macro
        when the physical button is released rather then when the button
        is pressed.</dd>

        <dt>Joystick</dt>
        <dd>The <em>Joystick</em> condition allows to use any physical
        joystick input as a condition. For buttons this is whether or
        not the button is pressed, for hats this is whether a particular
        direction is pressed, and for axis whether or not it currently
        is inside or outside a specified range.</dd>

        <dt>Keyboard</dt>
        <dd>The <em>Keyboard</em> conditions allows checking whether or
        not a particular keyboard key is pressed or not. This would
        typically be used to implement a modifier or shift key. To
        trigger different actions depending on the state of a key.</dd>
    </dl>
    Multiple of these conditions can also be used jointly by specifying
    whether or not an action / container should be executed if
    <em>any</em> or <em>all</em> of the conditions are satisfied.
</p>


<h2><a name="3_4">3.4 Containers</a></h2>

As the name implies containers are designed to hold one or more actions.
In addition to grouping actions together a container can also apply
further logic to groups of actions. Currently the following three types
of containers exist.

<h3>Basic</h3>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/container_basic.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Basic container widget.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    This container simply holds a group of actions without any further
    specific functionality. This is the default container and suitable
    for most situations.
</p>

<h3>Chain</h3>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/container_chain.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Chain container with two groups.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    This container holds several independent groups of actions. Each
    time the physical action with which this container is associated the
    next action group is executed. When the last group in the chain is
    reached the first group is executed again. Additionally, a timeout
    can be set after which the chain is reset to the first entry.
</p>

<h3>Double Tap</h3>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/container_double_tap.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Double tap container.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    This container holds two groups of actions, the first group is
    executed on a single button press while the second one is executed
    on a double press. The <em>Double tap delay</em> allows the modify
    the double tap speed, while <em>Single / Double tap</em> configures
    whether the single tap action is active together with the doble tap
    action or not. In the exclusive mode, the single tap action will be
    executed with a delay corresponding to the double tap delay.
</p>

<h3>Hat Buttons</h3>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">

        <em>Mapping of a hat to 4 action groups with two being
            populated.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    This container allows a hat to easily be mapped onto four or eight
    individual action groups. Each action group can contain any
    combination of actions that are valid for buttons and will be
    executed when the corresponding hat direction is triggered.

<h3>Smart Toggle</h3>
<div class="row bottom-gap">

        <em>Smart Toggle container with the action specified as a remap.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    The smart toggle container allows for a single group of actions that
    are have on and off states, such as remap and map to keyboard to be
    used in two manners. If the input is held down the action will
    perform as a typical remap action would, i.e. staying active as long
    as the input is pressed. However, when a short button press is
    detected, specified by the <em>Toggle time</em> then the first such
    press toggles the down state, i.e. holding the action down, and the
    second short press releases the action again.
</p>

<h3>Tempo</h3>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">

        <em>Tempo container with a remap action in both the short and
            long press action groups.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    This container holds two groups of actions that get executed under
    different conditions. The first one is run when the input is pressed
    for a duration shorter then the specified delay. The second group is
    run when the input is pressed for longer then the specified delay.
    Whether the first group is executed with the input being pressed or
    only when it is released can be controlled by the activation
    setting.
</p>


<h2><a name="3_5">3.5 Actions</a></h2>

<p class="text-justify">
    As described in <a href="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/overview/#1_2">Section 1.2</a>,
    each input, such as axis, button, hat, or keyboard key, can have multiple
    actions associated with it. However, not all inputs have access to the same
    types of actions as they are not applicable to them. In the following all
    available actions are described.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Each action has an activation condition associated with it, see <a
    href="#3_2">Section 3.2</a>, which can be used for fine grained
    control over them. Additionally, each input can also be configured to
    be always executed by checking the <em>Always Execute</em> box, see
    item 2 in the above image. Enabling this option results in actions
    associated with that input to be performed even if execution of
    callbacks is paused. This is mainly useful for resuming when
    execution has been paused.
</p>

<h3>Remapping</h3>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">

    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Hat remapping dialogue</em>
    </div>
</div>
</br>

<p class="text-justify">
    The remapping actions enable the user to propagate inputs from a
    physical joystick input to an equivalent vJoy input, i.e. axis to
    axis, button to button, and hat to hat. This allows the merging of
    multiple physical devices into a single device.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    In the case of axis remapping the condition can be used to press a
    vJoy button while the axis in a certain range and release it once
    the range is left. This could for example be used to engage
    afterburners when a throttle is set to greater then 95%.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    A remap actions for an axis can be configured in two ways: absolute,
    the physical input dicates the virtual output value directly, and
    relative, the physical input dicates the rate of change of the
    virtual output.
</p>

<p class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning text-justify">
    In most cases button remap actions should always trigger, i.e. on
    button press and release, as otherwise the forwarding to vJoy is
    incomplete.
</p>


<h3>Response Curve</h3>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/action_response_curve.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Response curve action dialogue which allows the customisation
            of the joystick response as well as dead zones.</em>
    </div>
</div>
</br>

<p class="text-justify">
    The response curve dialogue allows the customisation of
    the response produced by the joystick using the curve editor. The
    shape of the curve is controlled using a set of control points.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    A new control point is added by a double left click in an empty area
    of the curve editor. Removing an existing control point is achieved
    by selecting the desired point and pressing the <kbd>Del</kbd> key
    on the keyboard. A single left click on a control point will mark
    the point as active. An active point can be dragged in the window to
    modify its position. Alternatively, the text fields below the curve
    editor allow for precise numerical control of the position.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Finally, the dead zones for the axis can be defined using the sliders
    and input fields at the bottom of the dialogue. The fields and
    sliders control the full deflection dead zone (1st and 4th field
    from the left) as well as the centre deflection dead zones (2nd and
    3rd field).
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Currently there are two types of response curve types available which
    are selected from the drop down menu at the top of the widget:
    <dl class="dl-horizontal text-justify">
        <dt>Cubic Spline</dt>
        <dd>A simple spline with only control points dictating locations
            the curve has to pass through. No control over the shape is
            provided.</dd>
        <dt>Cubic B&eacute;zier Spline</dt>
        <dd>A more complex spline with control points and "handles" that
            can modify the shape of the overall curve. Importantly this
            allows to control how the curve approaches the end points of
            the curve.</dd>
    </dl>
</p>

<p class="bd-callout-warning bd-callout text-justify">
    A response curve mapping action always needs to be paired with a
    remap action, as otherwise the transformation will not have any
    effect.
</p>

<p class="bd-callout-warning bd-callout text-justify">
    In order for response curves to work properly the game has to be configured
    to use a linear 1:1 curve, as otherwise the two curve settings will
    interfere with each other producing undesirable results. This also applies
    when using vJoy response curves, if they are not linear the output produced
    by this action will be further modified.
</p>


<h3>Macro</h3>

<div class="row bottom-gap">

    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    The macro dialogue allows the creation of macros capable of emitting
    keyoard, mouse, and joystick events with timing information between
    individual events.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Adding new keystrokes to a macro is done by pressing the
    <em>Record</em> button, after which all keystrokes will be recorded
    sequentially. To stop the recording simply press the <em>Record</em>
    button again. A pause can be added by pressing the <em>Add
    Pause</em> button, which will insert a pause after the currently
    selected entry. The length of the pause can be modified by double
    clicking the entry. Selecting an entry allows it to be moved up and down
    using the <em>Up</em> and <em>Down</em> buttons.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
The stopwatch icon <img src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/gfx_icon_time.png"></img> allows recording the input
    delays when recording a macro. The buttons with labels
    <kbd>A</kbd>xis, <kbd>B</kbd>utton, <kbd>H</kbd>at,
    <kbd>K</kbd>eyboard, and <kbd>M</kbd>ouse allow enabling or
    disabling those specific input events when recording a macro.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Clicking on any entry in the action list allows modifying that entry
    as appropriate for the input. Alternatively the entire action can
    also be changed through the dialog on the right hand side of the
    action. In the bottom right corner, the <em>Macro Settings</em>
    section allows changing the behaviour of the macro.
    <em>Exclusive</em> ensures that no other macro is running when this
    one is executing. The dropdown allows selecting a repeat mode for
    the macro.

    <dl class="text-justify">
        <dt>None</dt>
        <dd>The macro is executed exactly once.</dd>

        <dt>Count</dt>
        <dd>The macro is executed as often as specified with the
        specified delay between subsequent executions.</dd>

        <dt>Hold</dt>
        <dd>The macro is executed as long as the (virtual) button is
        held down with a configurable delay between subsequent
        executions of the macro.</dd>

        <dt>Toggle</dt>
        <dd>On the first press of the (virtual) button the macro is
        started and will repeatedly execute with the specified delay
        between executions until the (virtual) button is pressed
        again.</dd>
    </dl>
</p>

<p class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning text-justify">
    Each macro is executed independently, which means that multiple long
    running macros can have their key presses interfere with each other.

<p class="text-justify">
    The map to keyboard action allows an arbitrary keyboard key sequence to be
    linked to a single physical input, such as a button. The specified keyboard

    This action allows using joystick axes, button, or a hat to control
    the relative motion of the mouse cursor as well as press mouse

    The pause, resume, and toggle actions control whether or not
    Joystick Gremlin executes callbacks when inputs are used. When the
    application is paused only inputs that were configured to <em>always
    execute</em> will be executed.
</p>

<p class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning text-justify">
    In order for the <em>resume</em> and <em>toggle</em> actions to be

<h2><a name="3_6">3.6 Profile Settings</a></h2>

<h3>Startup Mode</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    By default Gremlin uses a heuristic to figure out which mode to
    select upon activation of a profile. The mode selected is either the
    one that was active upon deactivation of Gremlin or the first mode
    without a parent in alphabetical order.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    If this heuristic is not suitable the drop down allows the selection
    of any of the modes present in the profile to be selected as the
    initial mode.
</p>

<h3>Default Macro Action Delay</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    The macro system will inject a fixed delay between individual
    non-pause actions. Certain games may require a longer delay between
    actions which can be set using this option.
</p>

<h3>vJoy as Input</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    In certain scenarios it can be desirable to have Gremlin treat a
    vJoy device as an input, e.g. when another program feeds a vJoy
    device but doesn't offer some features that Gremlin does. By
    checking the box next to the vJoy devices it will be treated as an
    input rather then output device.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    When a vJoy device is declared as an input device Gremlin will no
    longer show it as a target in the Remap action and other similar
    actions. However, a tab for that vJoy device will appear which
    allows adding actions to all the axes, buttons, and hats of the vJoy
    device remapping to other vJoy (output) devices.
</p>

<p class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning text-justify">
    This features was newly introduced in Release 11 and as such may
    still contain bugs and unforeseen interactions with other parts of
    Gremlin.
</p>


<h3>Initial vJoy Axes Values</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    By default Gremlin sets all vJoy axes to a value of 0.0, i.e.
    centered. In some situations this is not ideal, for example a
    throttle, and as such this section allows setting the initial value
    to use for each axis.
</p>


<h2><a name="3_7">3.7 Modules</a></h2>

<p class="text-justify">
    The <em>Modules</em> tab allows adding and configuring user plugins
    that can provide behaviour that is complicated or impossible to
    achieve through the UI otherwise.
</p>

<div class="row bottom-gap">

        <em>The modules tab allows adding and configuring of modules or
            user plugins.</em>
    </div>
</div>
</br>

<p class="text-justify">
    User plugins are the next development of the initial custom modules.
    Custom modules allowed extending Gremlin with arbitrary code.
    However, they were not very user friendly as they required code to
    be modified for simple adaptations to a user's setup. The new user
    plugins can be configured directly in the UI and can be used
    multiple times if the same functionality with slightly different
    settings is needed. An introduction into how to write such plugins
    can be found in <a href="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/user_plugins/">4. User
    Plugins</a>.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Adding a new plugin is achieved by clicking on the <em>Add
        Module</em> button and selecting the appropriate file. Once a
    plugin has been added additional instances can be created via the
    plus sign. Existing instances can be renamed via the pen icon, and
    removed by clicking on the minus sign. To configure an instance,
    press the cog icon.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    The configuration of a plugin instance allows setting all the
    exposed variables of the plugin. Each of the variables presents a UI
    appropriate to the particular type of input needed.
</p>


<h2><a name="3_8">3.8 Tools</a></h2>

<p class="text-justify">
    In the following section the various tools provided by Joystick
    Gremlin are described. They can be accessed via the <em>Tools</em>
    and <em>Actions</em> menus.
</p>


<h3>Mode Manager</h3>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/dialog_mode_manager.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>The mode manager allows the creation, deletion, and renaming
            of modes as well as defining their relationships.</em>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    The mode manager, accessed via <em>Tools > Manage Modes</em>, allows users
    to create new modes, delete existing ones and define which mode inherits
    configurations from others. Pressing "Add Mode" adds a new mode, pressing
    the button to the right of each mode with the <strong>x</strong> on it
    deletes it, and the button with a pen icon allows renaming a mode. Finally,
    using the drop down menu each mode can be configured to inherit from one
    other mode by selecting its name or not inheriting from any mode by
    selecting the "None" entry.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    A mode that inhertits from another is typicalled called a
    <em>child</em> and will perform the same actions as its
    <em>parent</em> when no actions are defined for a particular input.
</p>


<h3>Merge Axis</h3>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/dialog_merge_axis.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>This dialog allows the specification of two physical axis that
            should be combined into a single virtual one.</em>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    This dialog allows the selection of any arbitrary two physical axis and the
    virtual axis their combined output should be assigned to.
</p>


<h3>Input Repeater</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    When enabling the <em>Input Repeater</em> option, while Joystick
    Gremlin is active, via <em>Tools > Input Repeater</em>, Joystick
    Gremlin will repeat the last remapped input after a short wait
    period. This allows button presses and axes movements to be mapped
    in-game when the game detects the physical device's inputs instead
    of the virtual ones. The status bar provides information about the
    current action of the input repeater when activated.
</p>


<h3>Device Information</h3>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/dialog_device_information.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>The device information dialogue provides an overview of the
            inputs and identification of the various joystick devices
            present in the system.</em>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    Information about connected devices can be accessed via <em>Tools >
    Device Information</em>. This window provides an overview of the
    devices known to Joystick Gremlin, listing the name as well as some
    basic information about each device. The <em>Vendor ID</em> and
    <em>Product ID</em> represent the USB information about this device.
    The <em>GUID</em> is an identifier which is unique to each physical
    device on a particular Windows installation and is used by Gremlin
    to identify the different devices.
</p>


<h3>Calibration</h3>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/dialog_calibration.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>The calibration tool allows the calibration of all connected
            devices independent of Windows.</em>
    </div>
</div>
</br>

<p class="text-justify">
    The axes calibration screen, accessed via <em>Tools >
    Calibration</em>, allows the calibration of connected devices
    independent of Windows. The window shows the current, minimum,
    centre, and maximum value for each analogue axis of the selected
    device. To calibrate the axes simply move them through their full
    range of motions and press the <em>Centred</em> button when all axes
    are centred. Once done press <em>Save</em> to save the calibration
    of the currently selected device to the configuration file.
</p>

<h3>Input Viewer</h3>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/dialog_input_viewer.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>The input viewer allows visualizing the values of axes, buttons,
            and hats of all devices recognized by Gremlin.</em>
    </div>
</div>
</br>

<p class="text-justify">
    The input viewer allows visualizing the input from the physical as well as
    virtual devices. The window shows recognized devices and data
    visualizations for their inputs on the left hand side while the
    visualizations themselves will be shown in the right hand side of the
    window.
</p>

<h3>Cheatsheet Generation</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
    To help remember complex setups Joystick Gremlin has the ability to
    create PDF and HTML cheatsheets of the current profile. The output lists
    for each mode the actions of the available devices together with the
    user provided description.
</p>


<h3>Create 1:1 Mapping</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
    In order to make the initial setup quicker Joystick Gremlin can
    create a 1:1 mapping for the user. To do this select the entry from
    the <em>Actions</em> menu. This will result in each input being
    assigned the next free corresponding action, i.e. buttons are mapped
    to buttons and axes to axes.
</p>

<h3>Profile Creator</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
    In order to enable easier sharing of configurations, even if different
    devices are used, the Profile Creator allows creating a new profile from an
    existing one. When started the tool asks for a profile to use as a template
    and then presents all the bound actions within to the user for binding to
    their particular devices.
</p>

<div class="text-justify row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/dialog_profile_creator.png">
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-5">
        The interface shows:
        <ul>
            <li>Description of the action</li>
            <li>Type of actions used</li>
            <li>What input the action is currently bound to</li>
        </ul>
        Clicking on the button allows the user to press / move the input they wish
        to associate with the particular action. Once this is done the button will
        reflect this binding. When all desired actions are bound the configuration
        can be saved as a new profile by clicking on the save button.
    </div>
</div>

<p class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning text-justify">
    This tool is only capable of binding actions defined via the UI and if
    custom modules are used in a profile those will not be automatically
    adapted to the new devices used.
</p>

<h3>Log viewer</h3>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/dialog_log_viewer.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>The log viewer allows the user to easily check the content of the
            log file as well as clear it.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    The log viewer can be accessed via <em>Tools > Options</em> and allows easy
    viewing of both the system and user log files. The display is updated
    whenever the content of the log changes. Clearing the entire log is alos
    possible from this screen.
</p>

<h3>Swap Devices</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    While Gremlin should be able to always differentiate between
    physical devices there may be occasions when moving configurations
    associated with one device to another. This tool permits moving
    actions, macros, and conditions associated with one device to be
    moved to another connected one.
</p>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/dialog_swap_devices.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>This dialog allows swapping the actions assigned to
            identical devices between each other.</em>
    </div>
</div>


<h2><a name="3_9">3.9 Options</a></h2>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-fluid center-block" src="https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/images/dialog_options_general.png">

        <em>The options dialogue which is used to set some default
            settings and configure the profiles associated with
            programs.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    There are several user controllable options in Joystick Gremlin
    which can be controlled via the options dialogue, accessible through
    <em>Tools > Options</em>.    
</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
    The following options are accessible via the <em>General</em> tab:
    <dl class="text-justify">
        <dt>Highlight currently used input</dt>
        <dd>This option causes Joystick Gremlin to automatically select
            the input configuration matching the physical input's being
            used.</dd>
        <dt>Highlight swaps device tab</dt>
        <dd>With this option enabled, activating any physical input will
            swap to that device's tab if it is not the current one</dd>
        <dt>Closing minimizes to system tray</dt>
        <dd>Instead of quitting the application when it is closed, Joystick
            Gremlin is simply minimized to the system tray.</dd>
        <dt>Activate profile on launch</dt>
        <dd>This option causes Gremlin to activate the profile as soon
            as the program has started.<dd>
        <dt>Start Joystick Gremlin minimized</dt>
        <dd>Launches Joystick Gremlin minimized to the system tray instead of
            opening the main window.</dd>
        <dt>Show message when changing mode</dt>
        <dd>Displays a windows notification when the mode is changed.</dd>
        <dt>Default action<dt>
        <dd>Sets the action to be pre-selected in action selection drop down
            menus</dd>
        <dt>Macro axis polling rate</dt>
        <dd>This sets the rate at which axis values are recorded in the
            macro editor.</dd>
        <dt>Macro axis minimum change value<dt>
        <dd>This determines the minimum axis value change required to
            record a new entry in the macro editor.</dd>
    </dl>
</p>

<h3>Profiles</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
    The <em>Profiles</em> tab exposes the following options:
    <dl class="text-justify">
        <dt>Automatically load profile based on current application</dt>
        <dd>This option makes Joystick Gremlin to automatically load and
            activate the profile assigned to the currently active
            application.</dd>
    </dl>
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    The drop down menu and input fields allow selecting the executable
    and the profile associated with it. When an executable specified in
    this list is active the profile associated with it is automatically
    loaded and activated. Once the profile stops being the active one
    Joystick Gremlin is automatically stopped.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
    The edit icon allows changing the path of the selected executable or
    to enter a regular expression that will be used to match against the
    foreground process. Joystick Gremln will first attempt to find a
    direct match for an existing file and once this fails attempt to use
    the remaining entries as regular expressions, picking the first
    successful match.
</p>

<h3>HidGuardian</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    HidGuardian is a tool that solves the problem of a game seeing both
    the physical device and the virtual device at the same time and
    processing these inputs in unwanted ways. HidGuardian is capable of
    hiding those physical devices from all non whitelisted programs,
    thus effectively allowing games to be fooled into believing only the
    virtual devices exist.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    If Gremlin is started with admin priviliedges and <a
    href="https://github.com/ViGEm/HidGuardian">HidGuardian</a>
    (ideally installed through <a
    href="https://autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=34890">this
    tool</a>) is present this tab allows hiding and unhiding devices.
    Once a device's status was changed it has to be unplugged and replugged
    for HidGuardian to be able to use it.
</p>

<p class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning text-justify">
    This feature as well as HidGuardian are still in development. In
    fact HidGuardian is undergoing rework and as such newer versions
    will not work with Gremlin and this feature will be updated once
    HidGuardian has stabilized.
</p>

<p class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning text-justify">
    An alternative to HidGuardian, which is no longer in active development, is
    <a href="https://github.com/ViGEm/HidHide" target="_blank">HidHide</a> from
    the same author. HiHide is in active development and appears to work well
    even without additional convenience functionality provided by Gremlin.
</p>
