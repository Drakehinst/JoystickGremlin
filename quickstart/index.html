<h2>2.1 Installation & Setup</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
    On most sytems installing Joystick Gremlin only requires the installation
    of <a href="https://github.com/jshafer817/vJoy/releases/tag/v2.1.9.1" target="_blank">vJoy</a>
    and <a href="{{ site.url }}/download">Joystick Gremlin</a> itself. Once
    vJoy is installed it is advisable to configure the vJoy device(s), using
    vJoyConf, to contain the desired number of axes, buttons, and hats.

<h2>2.2 Simple Profiles</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
    The following is intended as a simple guide that introduces the
    concepts used in Joystick Gremlin by way of examples of how common
    tasks are achieved. One can think of Gremlin as a system that reacts
    to the user's input. This means that when the user does something
    Gremlin will react in a way specified by the user. In a sense the
    following summarizes the way Gremlin operates:
</p>

<div class="bd-callout">
    When I press this button on my joystick, I want the following to
    happen.
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    This is also reflected by the design of the UI which is divided into
    two halves. The left side lists all the physical inputs of a
    particular joystick, such as axes, buttons, and hats. The right side
    lists the actions associated with a particular physical input.
    Going back to the above idea the left hand side contains the
    &#8220;<em>When I do</em>&#8221; part while the
    right hand side reflects the &#8220;<em>Gremlin does</em>&#8221; part.

</p>

<h3>Basic Mappings</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    The simplest type of mappings are remapping a physical input to a
    virtual one with the <strong>Remap</strong> action. The other basic
    action is to map a physical input to a keyboard key or combination
    of keys using the <strong>Map to Keyboard</strong> action. Both of
    these actions will press and hold their virtual or simulated input
    for as long as the physical input is pressed.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    These actions allow merging of multiple physical devices into a
    single one which can be useful for games that only recognize a
    single joystick. Mapping joystick buttons to keyboard keys allows
    using the default bindings of a game without having to rebind
    everything or if a game doesn't support joystick input.
</p>


<h3>Macros</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    Sometimes it's not enough to simply press and hold a button, for
    example when a sequence of keys needs to be pressed or an axis
    ramped up in a particular manner. This is where the
    <strong>Macro</strong> action comes into play. This action allows the
    recording and customizing of events that should be played back when
    the associated physical input is pressed.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Besides simply executing the macro once upon activation it is also
    possible to have a macro repeat in a variety of ways:
    <ul>
        <li>Repeat a fixed number of times</li>
        <li>Repeat until the physical input is pressed again</li>
        <li>Repeat as long as the physical input is pressed</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h3>Dealing with Axes</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    Axes often require additional configuration by adding deadzones to prevent
    accidental inputs or a response curves that modify the response to a physical
    input. This allows increasing or reducing the sensitivity of particular
    areas of physical input to tailor the axis to a user's preference.  The
    horizontal axis of the curve editor reflects the physical deflection of the
    axis from minimum (left) to maximum (right) while the vertical axis
    reflects to output generated for the corresponding physical input.
</p>


<h2>2.3 Complex Profiles</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
    While simple profiles as described above are already capable of supporting
    a large variety of setups, sometimes a bit more complexity is required to
    create a particular setup. This is where <strong>containers</strong>,
    <strong>conditions</strong>, and <strong>modes</strong> come into play.
</p>

<h3>Container</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    A container holds one or more actions and is capable of executing
    additional logic specific to the container. The simplest container type
    <strong>Basic</strong> simply executes all contained actions. This is the type
    which we've used implicitly when creating a simple profile. There are
    currently two more advanced containers, <strong>Tempo</strong> and
    <strong>Chain</strong>. The tempo container executes different sets of actions
    depending on how long the corresponding physical input is pressed. This
    allows using a single button for two different actions where, for example,
    one is used more often then the other. The chain container contains an
    arbitrary number of action sets and with each press of the associated
    physical input the next set of ations in the chain are executed. When the last action
    set was processed the first one will be run next. This can be used when a
    single physical button should be used to switch through different actions.
</p>

<h3>Condition</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    Sometimes it can be helpful to control the condition under which an action
    or container is executed. The execution can thus be conditioned on the state
    of other input devices such as joysticks or keyboard, as well as the state
    of the input associated with the action or container. This can be used to
    implement a shift state which normally executes one action but if a certain
    button is pressed a different action is executed.
</p>

<h3>Mode</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    In certain situations it can be beneficial to split a profile into several
    parts, called modes. Each mode can have their own individual set of
    physical input to action mappings. For example in flight simulators this
    can be used to have one mode for air combat, one for ground attack, and one
    for communications. One powerful feature of the mode system is the
    <strong>inheritance</strong> capability. A mode can inherit from a single
    parent which results in the child mode executing whatever action their
    parent defined for a given input if the child has no actions of their own
    specified. This allows creating basic modes and then fine tuning them in a
    child mode for particular usage scenarios without having to duplicate
    common functionalities.
